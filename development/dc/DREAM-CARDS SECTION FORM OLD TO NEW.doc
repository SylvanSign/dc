\cf1 Councels of Prudence   Hazard Permanent Event \line Unique. A player's hand size is reduced by 1 for each of his companies that did not start legal movement during that player's movement/hazard phase. \line\i 'Then you would have us retreat to Minas Tirith, or Dol Amroth, or to Dunharrow, and there sit like children on sand-castles when the tide is flowing?' said Imrahil. - LOTR V\par
\par
\cf0\i0 The Road goes ever on and on   Hazard Permenant Event \line Corruption: Playable on a non-moving, non-Ringwraith character. Each character in his company receives 1 corruption point and must make a corruption check at the end of each turn. Discard this card at the start of the site phase if the character has moved to a new site this turn. Cannot be duplicated on a given character, cannot be played on-guard. \line\i The Road goes ever on and on \line Out from the door where it began. \line Now far ahead the Road has gone, \line Let others follow it who can! \line Let them a journey new begin\par
\par

Tap this faction to allow any one company to move up to 1 additional region. \line\i "They pay a tribute of horses," Gwaihir answered, "and send many yearly to Mordor, or so it is said; but they are not yet under the yoke. But if Saruman has become evil, as you say, then their doom cannot be long delayed." - LotR II\i0  \line\line Unferth   Minion Character - Warrior/Ranger Man \line Mind / Direct Influence : 4/1 \line Prowess / Body : 5/7 \line Unique. +2 direct influence against any faction playable at Edoras or any character with Edoras as home site. \line\i This was the stronghold of Saruman, as fame reported it; for within living memory the men of Rohan had not passed its gates, save perhaps a few, such as Wormtongue, who came in secret and told no man what they saw. - LotR III\i0  \line\line The Ithil-Stone MP 1   Minion Special Item \line Unique. Palant\'edr. Playable at Barad-d\'fbr if you are not Sauron. Discard if the bearer moves.

\par
Lament   Hero Resource Short-Event \line Playable during the site phase of a turn in which a character you controlled wwas eliminated if you tap a character that was in same company. If the eliminated character gave any negative points if eliminated (or was a wizard character), those negative points are reduced to 0. Draw two cards. \line\i Often they heard nearby Elvish voices singing, and knew that they were making songs of lamentation for his fall, for they caught his name among the sweet sad words that they could not understand. - LotR II \i0\line\par
Mourning   Hero Resource Permanent-event \line\b Playable during the site phase at a site that is also the home site of an eliminated non-wizard character.\b0  If the character gave you negative marshalling points, those negative points are reduced to 0. Cannot be duplicated on a given character.\par
\line Old Toby's   Hero Resource Short-Event \line Unique. Take one resource card that never gives you any marshalling points from your sideboard into your hand. Remove this card from the game. \line\i 'How Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded, for to his dying day he would not tell. He knew much about herbs, but he was no traveller. It is said that in his youth he went often to Bree, though he certainly never went further from the Shire than that. - LotR I\i0  \line\line Lure of the Ithil Stone    Hero Resource Permanent-Event CP : 2 \line Unique. Play on a character you control. The character receives 2 corruption points. If a character in his company plays the Ithil-Stone, add 3 to the roll required by the Ithil-Stone. A bearer of the Ithil-Stone in same company gets +2 to each of his Corruption checks. A Saurn player gets -4 to his general influence. \line\line Lore of Gondolin MP 1 (2)    Hero Resource Permanent-Event \line Lost knowledge. Playable during the site phase at a site where information is playable on a sage. Tap the site and the sage. An elf character in sage's company may tap to reduce the body of an attack against sage's company by 1. Elf makes a corruption check modified by -1. This card is worth 2 MPs if stored at a Haven. \line\line Steward of Gondor    Hero Resource Permanent-Event \line Playable on Denethor II if he is at Minas Tirith. +2 to his Direct Influence and his corruption checks while he bears a Palant\'edr. When Denethor II uses a palant\'edr, your hand size increases by 1 until your next organization phase. \line\line Met in the midst of battle   Hero Resource Short-Event \line Play when two or more of your companies join at a non-Haven site to draw a card for every character in those companies. \line\i Yet twice blessed is help unlooked for, and never was a meeting of friends more joyful. - LOTR V\i0  \line\par
Met in the midst of battle  Hero Resource Long-event \line At the beginning of each company's site phase at a non-haven site, draw 2 cards if more than 1 company moved to this site this turn.\par
\line Three is Company  Hero Resource Long-Event \line All corruption checks made by a character in a company with at least three characters get +1. All attacks against such a company get -1 prowess. \line\i Then he called aloud to the others, and all the company stopped and gathered round. 'This is indeed wonderful!' they said. 'Three hobbits in a wood at night! We have not seen such a thing since Bilbo went away. What is the meaning of it?' - LOTR I\i0  \line\line Knights of the Westfold   Hero Man Faction - MP 2 \line Unique. Playable at Glittering Caves if the influence check is greater than 8. Standard Modifications: Dunedain (+1), Men (+2). \line\i Behind them were gathered a great host, both of the Riders and of the people of Westfold, old and young, women and children, who had come out from the caves. A song of victory they sang with clear voices; and then they fell silent... - LotR III\i0  \line\line Muster of Rohan   Hero Resource Permanent-Event - MP (1) \line Unique. Riders of Rohan may be played at Dunharrow rather than at Edoras if the influence check is greater than 11 instead (with same modifications). Place this card with Riders of Rohan when you play them - only then is this card worth its marshalling points. \line\i So the King of the Mark came back victorious out of the West to Dunharrow beneath the feet of the White Mountains. There he found the remaining strength of his people already assembled;\i0  \line\line His Will Hardened   Hero Resource Permanent -Event \line A character may tap to give another character in his company +1 to an influence check OR to give a character in his company +1 to the check to remove a hazard permanent-event (e.g. Lure of Nature, Foolish words). \line\i But even as hope died in Sam, or seemed to die, it was turned to a new strength. Sam's plain hobbit-face grew stern, almost grim, ... and he felt through all his limbs a thrill, as if he was turning into some creature of stone and steel that neither despair nor weariness nor endless barren miles could subdue. - LOTR VI\i0  \line\line Power According To His Stature   Hero Resource Permanent-Event \line MP : 1 \line Sage only. Playable on the bearer or a ring special item at an untapped site where information is playable. Tap the sage and the site. If bearer is a sage, this card gives an additional marshalling point and corruption point.

If this character just tapped to support a Corruption check, to support a character facing a strike from an attack or to cancel an attack of a hazard creature with more than one attack, tap this card to untap the character. \line\line The Master   Hero Resource Permanent-Event \line Playable on a company containing Goldberry. If Tom Bombadil is in this company, he is not discarded if his company moves to a site in a region adjacent to Arthedain, Cardolan or Rhudaur and once per turn, a character in this company may tap to untap Tom Bombadil.\par
\par

When you store this card, you may take a unique hero faction into hand from your play deck or discard.\par
\par
\cf2\b Unfounded Whisperings\b0    Hazard Short Event \line\i Playable at any time during your opponents turn and does not count against the hazard limit. \i0 Targets and cancels the effects of a Marvels Told or Voices of Malice not played by a Wizard/Ringwraith or a character with a mind greater than 5, which was declared earlier in the same chain of events. Remove this card from the game.\par
\par
Sauron's Torture   Minion Permanent Event \line Playable at Barad-dur if Stinker is there. Discard Stinker. For the rest of the game, any ring tested at the minion version of Bag End has its result modified by +3.\par
\par
\cf3 I NEED SMOKE   Hazard Permanent Event \line Whenever a player accesses his sideboard during his own turn, he must tap an additional character in addition to the other requirements for accessing the sideboard. If a character cannot be tapped, the sideboard cannot be accessed. \line\line\i 'I know what is the matter with me," he muttered, as he sat down by the door. 'I need smoke! I have not tasted it since the morning before the snowstorm.'\i0  -LotR II\par
\par
\cf1 Twilight's Call  Hazard Permanent Event \line Corruption. Playable on a non-Wizard character. Target character recieves gets 2 corruption points (3 if an elf). If target is an Hobbit, Man or Dunedain, he makes a corruption check at the beginning of each untap phase if Doors of Night is in play. If target is an Orc or Troll, he makes a corruption check at the beginning of each untap phase if Gates of Morning or Skies of Fire is in play. A player may discard a Twilight from hand to discard this card. \line 2 Corruption Points \line\line The White Tree [(6)]  Minion Permanent Event \line Playable on a company containing a sage at a Darkhaven. Minas Tirith has an additional automatic attack against minion companies : Dunedain - 4 strikes at 12. You can tap this card during the same site phase in which a character in the company plays a Sapling of the White Tree at Minas Tirith (discard the sapling). Only if tapped can this card be stored, and you recieve this card's marshalling points only if you store this card at Barad-D\'fbr. Once stores, each hero Dunedain character recieves +1 to his mind attribute and gives -1 marshalling point.\par
\par
Crafter's Jewelry   Permanent Event - Misc MP : 2 Or 1 item point\par
Unique. Playable at a Haven if you tap an elven sage in bearer's company to place this card with Emerald of Doriath. Emerald of Doriath gives an additional +1 direct influence and its bearer may tap to attempt to discard a hazard permanent-event on a character in his company; make a roll and if its result is less than bearer's mind (10 for a Wizard) the hazard permanent-event is discarded.\par
\par
Mark of Curufin   Special Item : MP : 1 \line Unique. Playable at a Haven on the bearer of an elfstone, tap haven and discard the elfstone. Bearer gets +2 direct influence and may tap to cancel an agent attack or all effects of a hazard action that targets a card in his company. \line CP : 2\par
\par
\cf2 THE NINE SET FORTH    TYPE: Resource \line CLASS: Permanent-event \line A Ringwraith company in Fell Rider, Black Rider or Heralded Lord mode may move with region movement to a non Under-deeps site. Based on the marshalling point (MP) total of your opponent, he may use the following number of regions: 0-8 MPs 1 region; 9-16 MPs 2 regions; 17-24 MPs 3 regions; 25+ MPs 4 regions. This region allowance may not be modified by any other effects.\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi708\par
I had thought about making it rings instead of MP total, similar to way the hazard, The Nazgul Are Abroad, operates. However, I think the only way a region allowance based on rings would be useful is if it was in addition to a region allowance based on MPs. Otherwise the card simply wouldn't be useful enough (since ring strategies aren't common) to warrant inclusion in an active RW deck.\par
\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\cf0\par
\cf3 Shadows of the Power  Minion Resource   2 MP Permanent Event \line\b Playable on your Ringwraith during the Organization phase at a Darkhaven if your Ringwraith discards (for no effect) a Ring Item it bears.\b0  -5 to General Influence. +3 to direct influence. Your Ringwraith is in Heralded Lord Mode, may use starter movment and may be in a company with other non-ringwraith characters. All other limitations on company composition still apply. \par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi708\par
Hopefully, this card would be sufficiently difficult to get out to counterbalance having your Ringwraith lead a company around. And the -5 to GI would definitely make this card not too powerful.\par

\cf2\b Lieutenant of Barad-Dur\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\fi708\b0 It always seemed to me that the Mouth got a little shafted (and even inaccurately portrayed) as a Minion. Here's a different version: \line Lieutenant of Barad-Dur \line 9 Mind 4 DI \line 3 MP 6/8 Warrior/Diplomat Dunadan \line Unique. Manifestation of Mouth of Sauron and the Mouth. Can use Sorcery. During your end-of-turn phase, you may bring one Diplomat Only card from your discard pile to your hand. \line\line "But it is told that he was a renegade, who came of the race of those that are named the Black Numenoreans . . . and he learned great sorcery, and knew much of the mind of Sauron." \line -LotR VI \line Note that he is described as a Numenorean (albeit Fallen), not a Man. Note also that in the books he could use Sorcery\par
\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\cf4\par
\cf2 Master of Wood, Water and Hill   Creature or Short-event \line Marshalling points: 6* \line Prowess/body: 18/11 \line Unique. Maia. Manifestation of Tom Bombadil. May not be played against a hero opponent. As a creature, playable in The Old Forest. If Gates of Morning is in play, also playable keyed to Arthedain, The Shire, Rhudaur or Cardolan, and at sites in these regions. As a short-event, playable against a covert company moving with at least two wildernesses in its site-path. All non-ringwraith character in the company must make a corruption check modified by -2.\par
\par

As a short-event, all characters in an overt company receive \endash 1 prowess and \endash 1 body for remainder of turn.\par
\par
\par
\cf4 Those of the Unlight (revised)    Hazard Permanent Event \line\b Unique\b0  Playable only if Doors of Night is in play. Nazgul creatures count also as Undead. Discard when any playdeck is exhausted or if Doors of Night leaves play.\par
